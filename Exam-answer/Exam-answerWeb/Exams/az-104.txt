You plan to create an Azure Storage account in the Azure region of East US 2.
You need to create a storage account that meets the following requirements:
Replicates synchronously.
Remains available if a single data center in the region fails.
How should you configure the storage account? To answer, select the appropriate options in the answer area.
NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.
---
Replication:;GRS;LRS;RA GRS;ZRS *;
Account type:Blob storage;Storage (general purpose v1); StorageV2 (general purpose v2) *;
---
Zone-redundant storage (ZRS) replicates your data synchronously across three storage clusters in a single region.
LRS would not remain available if a data center in the region fails
GRS and RA GRS use asynchronous replication.
ZRS only support GPv2.

Data in an Azure Storage account is always replicated three times in the primary region. Azure Storage offers two options for how your data is replicated in the primary region:

Locally redundant storage (LRS) copies your data synchronously three times within a single physical location in the primary region. LRS is the least expensive replication option, but is not recommended for applications requiring high availability.
Zone-redundant storage (ZRS) copies your data synchronously across three Azure availability zones in the primary region. For applications requiring high availability, Microsoft recommends using ZRS in the primary region, and also replicating to a secondary region.

Microsoft updates, which Microsoft refers to as planned maintenance events, sometimes require that VMs be rebooted to complete the update. To reduce the impact on VMs, the Azure fabric is divided into update domains to ensure that not all VMs are rebooted at the same time.
An update domain is a group of VMs and underlying physical hardware that can be rebooted at the same time.
A fault domain shares common storage as well as a common power source and network switch. It is used to protect against unplanned system failure.

You have an Azure subscription that contains the storage accounts shown in the following table.
az-104-q35.png
You need to identify which storage account can be converted to zone-redundant storage (ZRS) replication by requesting a live migration from Azure support.
What should you identify?
---
storage1
storage2 *
storage3
storage4
---
ZRS currently supports standard general-purpose v2, FileStorage and BlockBlobStorage storage account types.
Live migration is supported only for storage accounts that use LRS replication. If your account uses GRS or RA-GRS, then you need to first change your account's replication type to LRS before proceeding. This intermediary step removes the secondary endpoint provided by GRS/RA-GRS.
Also, only standard storage account types support live migration. Premium storage accounts must be migrated manually.
ZRS currently supports standard general-purpose v2, FileStorage and BlockBlobStorage storage account types.

You have an Azure subscription that contains a storage account named account1.
You plan to upload the disk files of a virtual machine to account1 from your on-premises network. The on-premises network uses a public IP address space of
131.107.1.0/24.
You plan to use the disk files to provision an Azure virtual machine named VM1. VM1 will be attached to a virtual network named VNet1. VNet1 uses an IP address space of 192.168.0.0/24.
You need to configure account1 to meet the following requirements:
Ensure that you can upload the disk files to account1.
Ensure that you can attach the disks to VM1.
Prevent all other access to account1.
Which two actions should you perform? 
---
From the Firewalls and virtual networks blade of account1, select Selected networks. *
From the Firewalls and virtual networks blade of account1, select Allow trusted Microsoft services to access this storage account.
From the Firewalls and virtual networks blade of account1, add the 131.107.1.0/24 IP address range.
From the Firewalls and virtual networks blade of account1, add VNet1.
From the Service endpoints blade of VNet1, add a service endpoint. *
---
By default, storage accounts accept connections from clients on any network. To limit access to selected networks, you must first change the default action.
Azure portal -
1. Navigate to the storage account you want to secure.
2. Click on the settings menu called Firewalls and virtual networks.
3. To deny access by default, choose to allow access from 'Selected networks'. To allow traffic from all networks, choose to allow access from 'All networks'.
4. Click Save to apply your changes.

You have an Azure web app named App1. App1 has the deployment slots shown in the following table:
az-104-q42.png
In webapp1-test, you test several changes to App1.
You back up App1.
You swap webapp1-test for webapp1-prod and discover that App1 is experiencing performance issues.
You need to revert to the previous version of App1 as quickly as possible.
What should you do?
---
Redeploy App1
Swap the slots *
Clone App1
Restore the backup of App1
---
When you swap deployment slots, Azure swaps the Virtual IP addresses of the source and destination slots, thereby swapping the URLs of the slots. We can easily revert the deployment by swapping back.
When you deploy your web app, web app on Linux, mobile back end, or API app to Azure App Service, you can use a separate deployment slot instead of the default production slot when you're running in the Standard, Premium, or Isolated App Service plan tier. Deployment slots are live apps with their own host names. App content and configurations elements can be swapped between two deployment slots, including the production slot.

Deploying your application to a non-production slot has the following benefits:

You can validate app changes in a staging deployment slot before swapping it with the production slot.
Deploying an app to a slot first and swapping it into production makes sure that all instances of the slot are warmed up before being swapped into production. This eliminates downtime when you deploy your app. The traffic redirection is seamless, and no requests are dropped because of swap operations. You can automate this entire workflow by configuring auto swap when pre-swap validation isn't needed.
After a swap, the slot with previously staged app now has the previous production app. If the changes swapped into the production slot aren't as you expect, you can perform the same swap immediately to get your "last known good site" back.
Each App Service plan tier supports a different number of deployment slots. There's no additional charge for using deployment slots. To find out the number of slots your app's tier supports, see App Service limits.

VM1 hosts a frontend application that connects to VM2 to retrieve data.
Users report that the frontend application is slower than usual.
You need to view the average round-trip time (RTT) of the packets from VM1 to VM2.
Which Azure Network Watcher feature should you use?
---
IP flow verify
Connection troubleshoot
Connection monitor *
NSG flow logs
---
Network Watcher Connection Monitor enables you to configure and track connection reachability, latency, and network topology changes. If there is an issue, it tells you why it occurred and how to fix it.
The IP flow verify capability enables you to specify a source and destination IPv4 address, port, protocol (TCP or UDP), and traffic direction (inbound or outbound). IP flow verify then tests the communication and informs you if the connection succeeds or fails. If the connection fails, IP flow verify tells you which security rule allowed or denied the communication, so that you can resolve the problem.
The connection troubleshoot capability enables you to test a connection between a VM and another VM, an FQDN, a URI, or an IPv4 address. The test returns similar information returned when using the connection monitor capability, but tests the connection at a point in time, rather than monitoring it over time, as connection monitor does.
The NSG flow log capability allows you to log the source and destination IP address, port, protocol, and whether traffic was allowed or denied by an NSG.

The type of VPN you can choose depends on the make and model of your VPN device, and the kind of VPN connection you intend to create. Choose a route-based gateway if you intend to use point-to-site, inter-virtual network, or multiple site-to-site connections; if you are creating a VPN type gateway to coexist with an ExpressRoute gateway; or if you need to use IKEv2. Policy-based gateways support only IKEv1
olicy-based vs. route-based VPN devices differ in how the IPsec traffic selectors are set on a connection:

Policy-based VPN devices use the combinations of prefixes from both networks to define how traffic is encrypted/decrypted through IPsec tunnels. It is typically built on firewall devices that perform packet filtering. IPsec tunnel encryption and decryption are added to the packet filtering and processing engine.
Route-based VPN devices use any-to-any (wildcard) traffic selectors, and let routing/forwarding tables direct traffic to different IPsec tunnels. It is typically built on router platforms where each IPsec tunnel is modeled as a network interface or VTI (virtual tunnel interface).

Forward DNS resolution is supported across virtual networks that are linked to the private zone as resolution virtual networks. VM5 does belong to a resolution virtual network.
VM6 belongs to registration virtual network, and an A (Host) record exists for VM9 in the DNS zone.
By default, registration virtual networks also act as resolution virtual networks, in the sense that DNS resolution against the zone works from any of the virtual machines within the registration virtual network.

Azure Virtual WAN is a networking service that brings many networking, security, and routing functionalities together to provide a single operational interface. These functionalities include branch connectivity (via connectivity automation from Virtual WAN Partner devices such as SD-WAN or VPN CPE), Site-to-site VPN connectivity, remote user VPN (Point-to-site) connectivity, private (ExpressRoute) connectivity, intra-cloud connectivity (transitive connectivity for virtual networks), VPN ExpressRoute inter-connectivity, routing, Azure Firewall, and encryption for private connectivity. You do not have to have all of these use cases to start using Virtual WAN. You can simply get started with just one use case, and then adjust your network as it evolves.

The Virtual WAN architecture is a hub and spoke architecture with scale and performance built in for branches (VPN/SD-WAN devices), users (Azure VPN/OpenVPN/IKEv2 clients), ExpressRoute circuits, and virtual networks. It enables global transit network architecture, where the cloud hosted network 'hub' enables transitive connectivity between endpoints that may be distributed across different types of 'spokes'.

Azure regions serve as hubs that you can choose to connect to. All hubs are connected in full mesh in a Standard Virtual WAN making it easy for the user to use the Microsoft backbone for any-to-any (any spoke) connectivity. For spoke connectivity with SD-WAN/VPN devices, users can either manually set it up in Azure Virtual WAN, or use the Virtual WAN CPE (SD-WAN/VPN) partner solution to set up connectivity to Azure. We have a list of partners that support connectivity automation (ability to export the device info into Azure, download the Azure configuration and establish connectivity) with Azure Virtual WAN.

A Recovery Services vault is a logical container that stores the backup data for each protected resource, such as Azure VMs. When the backup job for a protected resource runs, it creates a recovery point inside the Recovery Services vault.
There are three application tiers, each with five virtual machines.
Move all the virtual machines for App1 to Azure.
Ensure that all the virtual machines for App1 are protected by backups.
Azure Storage Explorer is a free tool from Microsoft that allows you to work with Azure Storage data on Windows, macOS, and Linux. You can use it to upload and download data from Azure blob storage.
Planned Changes include: move the existing product blueprint files to Azure Blob storage.
Technical Requirements include: Copy the blueprint files to Azure over the Internet.
Contoso is moving the existing product blueprint files to Azure Blob storage.
Use unmanaged standard storage for the hard disks of the virtual machines. We use Page Blobs for these.
