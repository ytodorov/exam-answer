You develop a software as a service (SaaS) offering to manage photographs. Users upload photos to a web service which then stores the photos in Azure
Storage Blob storage. The storage account type is General-purpose V2.
When photos are uploaded, they must be processed to produce and save a mobile-friendly version of the image. The process to produce a mobile-friendly version of the image must start in less than one minute.
You need to design the process that starts the photo processing.
Solution: Convert the Azure Storage account to a BlockBlobStorage storage account.
Does the solution meet the goal?
---
A. Yes
B. No *
---
Not necessary to convert the account, instead move photo processing to an Azure Function triggered from the blob upload..
Azure Storage events allow applications to react to events. Common Blob storage event scenarios include image or video processing, search indexing, or any file- oriented workflow.
Note: Only storage accounts of kind StorageV2 (general purpose v2) and BlobStorage support event integration. Storage (general purpose v1) does not support integration with Event Grid.

Azure Storage events allow applications to react to events, such as the creation and deletion of blobs. It does so without the need for complicated code or expensive and inefficient polling services. The best part is you only pay for what you use.

Blob storage events are pushed using Azure Event Grid to subscribers such as Azure Functions, Azure Logic Apps, or even to your own http listener. Event Grid provides reliable event delivery to your applications through rich retry policies and dead-lettering.

###
You are developing an application that uses Azure Blob storage.
The application must read the transaction logs of all the changes that occur to the blobs and the blob metadata in the storage account for auditing purposes. The changes must be in the order in which they occurred, include only create, update, delete, and copy operations and be retained for compliance reasons.
You need to process the transaction logs asynchronously.
What should you do?
---
A. Process all Azure Blob storage events by using Azure Event Grid with a subscriber Azure Function app.
B. Enable the change feed on the storage account and process all changes for available events. *
C. Process all Azure Storage Analytics logs for successful blob events.
D. Use the Azure Monitor HTTP Data Collector API and scan the request body for successful blob events.
---
Change feed support in Azure Blob Storage
The purpose of the change feed is to provide transaction logs of all the changes that occur to the blobs and the blob metadata in your storage account. The change feed provides ordered, guaranteed, durable, immutable, read-only log of these changes. Client applications can read these logs at any time, either in streaming or in batch mode. The change feed enables you to build efficient and scalable solutions that process change events that occur in your Blob Storage account at a low cost.
The change feed is stored as blobs in a special container in your storage account at standard blob pricing cost. You can control the retention period of these files based on your requirements (See the conditions of the current release). Change events are appended to the change feed as records in the Apache Avro format specification: a compact, fast, binary format that provides rich data structures with inline schema. This format is widely used in the Hadoop ecosystem, Stream Analytics, and Azure Data Factory.

You are developing a web app that is protected by Azure Web Application Firewall (WAF). All traffic to the web app is routed through an Azure Application
Gateway instance that is used by multiple web apps. The web app address is contoso.azurewebsites.net.
All traffic must be secured with SSL. The Azure Application Gateway instance is used by multiple web apps.
You need to configure the Azure Application Gateway for the app.
Which two actions should you perform? Each correct answer presents part of the solution.
NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.
---
A. In the Azure Application Gateway's HTTP setting, enable the Use for App service setting. *
B. Convert the web app to run in an Azure App service environment (ASE).
C. Add an authentication certificate for contoso.azurewebsites.net to the Azure Application gateway.
D. In the Azure Application Gateway's HTTP setting, set the value of the Override backend path option to contoso22.azurewebsites.net. *
---
The ability to specify a host override is defined in the HTTP settings and can be applied to any back-end pool during rule creation.
The ability to derive the host name from the IP or FQDN of the back-end pool members. HTTP settings also provide an option to dynamically pick the host name from a back-end pool member's FQDN if configured with the option to derive host name from an individual back-end pool member.
SSL termination and end to end SSL with multi-tenant services.
In case of end to end SSL, trusted Azure services such as Azure App service web apps do not require whitelisting the backends in the application gateway.
Therefore, there is no need to add any authentication certificates.

You are a developer for a software as a service (SaaS) company that uses an Azure Function to process orders. The Azure Function currently runs on an Azure
Function app that is triggered by an Azure Storage queue.
You are preparing to migrate the Azure Function to Kubernetes using Kubernetes-based Event Driven Autoscaling (KEDA).
You need to configure Kubernetes Custom Resource Definitions (CRD) for the Azure Function.
Which CRDs should you configure?
---
Azure Function code:;Secret;Deployment;ScaledObject;TriggerAuthentication;
Pooling Interval:;Azure Function code:;Secret;Deployment;ScaledObject;TriggerAuthentication;
Azure Storage connection string:;Azure Function code:;Secret;Deployment;ScaledObject;TriggerAuthentication;
---
Deployment - To deploy Azure Functions to Kubernetes use the func kubernetes deploy command has several attributes that directly control how our app scales, once it is deployed to Kubernetes.
ScaledObject - With --polling-interval, we can control the interval used by KEDA to check Azure Service Bus Queue for messages.
Secret - Store connection strings in Kubernetes Secrets.

KEDA is a Kubernetes-based Event Driven Autoscaler. With KEDA, you can drive the scaling of any container in Kubernetes based on the number of events needing to be processed.

KEDA is a single-purpose and lightweight component that can be added into any Kubernetes cluster. KEDA works alongside standard Kubernetes components like the Horizontal Pod Autoscaler and can extend functionality without overwriting or duplication. With KEDA you can explicitly map the apps you want to use event-driven scale, with other apps continuing to function. This makes KEDA a flexible and safe option to run alongside any number of any other Kubernetes applications or frameworks.

You are building a traffic monitoring system that monitors traffic along six highways. The system produces time series analysis-based reports for each highway.
Data from traffic sensors are stored in Azure Event Hub.
Traffic data is consumed by four departments. Each department has an Azure Web App that displays the time series-based reports and contains a WebJob that processes the incoming data from Event Hub. All Web Apps run on App Service Plans with three instances.
Data throughput must be maximized. Latency must be minimized.
You need to implement the Azure Event Hub.
Which settings should you use? 
---
Number of partitions:;3;4;6 *;12;
Partition Key:;Highway *;Department;Timestamp;VM name;
---
The number of partitions is specified at creation and must be between 2 and 32. There are 6 highways.
Event Hubs provides message streaming through a partitioned consumer pattern in which each consumer only reads a specific subset, or partition, of the message stream. This pattern enables horizontal scale for event processing and provides other stream-focused features that are unavailable in queues and topics.
A partition is an ordered sequence of events that is held in an event hub. As newer events arrive, they are added to the end of this sequence. A partition can be thought of as a "commit log."
Event Hubs retains data for a configured retention time that applies across all partitions in the event hub. Events expire on a time basis; you cannot explicitly delete them. Because partitions are independent and contain their own sequence of data, they often grow at different rates.

Contoso, Ltd. provides an API to customers by using Azure API Management (APIM). The API authorizes users with a JWT token.
You must implement response caching for the APIM gateway. The caching mechanism must detect the user ID of the client that accesses data for a given location and cache the response for that user ID.
You need to add the following policies to the policies file:
✑ a set-variable policy to store the detected user identity
✑ a cache-lookup-value policy
✑ a cache-store-value policy
a find-and-replace policy to update the response body with the user profile information

To which policy section should you add the policies? 
---
Set-variable;Inbound *;Outbound;
Cache-lookup-value;Inbound *;Outbound;
Cache-store-value;Inbound;Outbound *;
Find-and-replace;Inbound;Outbound *;
---
The set-variable policy declares a context variable and assigns it a value specified via an expression or a string literal. if the expression contains a literal it will be converted to a string and the type of the value will be System.String.
Use the cache-lookup-value policy to perform cache lookup by key and return a cached value. The key can have an arbitrary string value and is typically provided using a policy expression.
The cache-store-value performs cache storage by key. The key can have an arbitrary string value and is typically provided using a policy expression.
The find-and-replace policy finds a request or response substring and replaces it with a different substring.

Network (CDN) Standard for the web endpoint. Customer videos are downloaded from the web app by using the following example URL.: http://www.contoso.com/ content.mp4?quality=1
All media content must expire from the cache after one hour. Customer videos with varying quality must be delivered to the closest regional point of presence (POP) node.
You need to configure Azure CDN caching rules.
Which options should you use?
---
Caching behavior:;Bypass cache;Override *;Set if missing;
Cache expiration duration:;1 second;1 minute;1 hour *;1 day;
Query string caching behavior:;Ignore query strings;Bypass caching for query strings;Cache every unique URL *;
---
Override: Ignore origin-provided cache duration; use the provided cache duration instead. This will not override cache-control: no-cache. Set if missing: Honor origin-provided cache-directive headers, if they exist; otherwise, use the provided cache duration.
All media content must expire from the cache after one hour.
Cache every unique URL: In this mode, each request with a unique URL, including the query string, is treated as a unique asset with its own cache. For example, the response from the origin server for a request for example.ashx?q=test1 is cached at the POP node and returned for subsequent caches with the same query string. A request for example.ashx?q=test2 is cached as a separate asset with its own time-to-live setting.

Service Bus is intended for traditional enterprise applications. These enterprise applications require transactions, ordering, duplicate detection, and instantaneous consistency. Service Bus enables cloud-native applications to provide reliable state transition management for business processes. When handling high-value messages that cannot be lost or duplicated, use Azure Service Bus. Service Bus also facilitates highly secure communication across hybrid cloud solutions and can connect existing on-premises systems to cloud solutions.

Service Bus is a brokered messaging system. It stores messages in a "broker" (for example, a queue) until the consuming party is ready to receive the messages.

It has the following characteristics:

reliable asynchronous message delivery (enterprise messaging as a service) that requires polling
advanced messaging features like FIFO, batching/sessions, transactions, dead-lettering, temporal control, routing and filtering, and duplicate detection
at least once delivery
optional in-order delivery

You must store the device data in Azure Blob storage. Device data must be correlated based on a device identifier. Additional stores are expected to open in the future.
You need to implement a solution to receive the device data.
Solution: Provision an Azure Event Grid. Configure event filtering to evaluate the device identifier.
Does the solution meet the goal?

Instead use an Azure Service Bus, which is used order processing and financial transactions.
Note: An event is a lightweight notification of a condition or a state change. Event hubs is usually used reacting to status changes.
