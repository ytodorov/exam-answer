You plan to create an Azure Storage account in the Azure region of East US 2.
You need to create a storage account that meets the following requirements:
Replicates synchronously.
Remains available if a single data center in the region fails.
How should you configure the storage account? To answer, select the appropriate options in the answer area.
NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.
---
Replication:;GRS;LRS;RA GRS;ZRS *;
Account type:Blob storage;Storage (general purpose v1); StorageV2 (general purpose v2) *;
---
Zone-redundant storage (ZRS) replicates your data synchronously across three storage clusters in a single region.
LRS would not remain available if a data center in the region fails
GRS and RA GRS use asynchronous replication.
ZRS only support GPv2.

Data in an Azure Storage account is always replicated three times in the primary region. Azure Storage offers two options for how your data is replicated in the primary region:

Locally redundant storage (LRS) copies your data synchronously three times within a single physical location in the primary region. LRS is the least expensive replication option, but is not recommended for applications requiring high availability.
Zone-redundant storage (ZRS) copies your data synchronously across three Azure availability zones in the primary region. For applications requiring high availability, Microsoft recommends using ZRS in the primary region, and also replicating to a secondary region.

VM1 and VM2.
What should you include in the Availability Set?
---
A. one update domain
B. two fault domains
C. one fault domain
D. two update domains *
---
Microsoft updates, which Microsoft refers to as planned maintenance events, sometimes require that VMs be rebooted to complete the update. To reduce the impact on VMs, the Azure fabric is divided into update domains to ensure that not all VMs are rebooted at the same time.
An update domain is a group of VMs and underlying physical hardware that can be rebooted at the same time.
A fault domain shares common storage as well as a common power source and network switch. It is used to protect against unplanned system failure.

Cloud Tiering: A switch to enable or disable cloud tiering. When enabled, cloud tiering will tier files to your Azure file shares. This converts on-premises file shares into a cache, rather than a complete copy of the dataset, to help you manage space efficiency on your server. With cloud tiering, infrequently used or accessed files can be tiered to Azure Files.

D
You have several Azure virtual machines on a virtual network named VNet1.
You configure an Azure Storage account as shown in the following exhibit.
az-104-q33.png
Choose all that apply:
---
The virtual machines on the 10.2.9.0/24 subnet will have network connectivity to the file shares in the storage account:;always;during a backup;never *;
Azure Backup will be able to back up the unmanaged hard disks of the virtual machines in the storage account:;always;during a backup;never *;
---
Endpoint status is enabled, but 10.2.9.0/24 is not allowed
After you configure firewall and virtual network settings for your storage account, select Allow trusted Microsoft services to access this storage account as an exception to enable Azure Backup service to access the network restricted storage account.

###
C
You have a sync group named Sync1 that has a cloud endpoint. The cloud endpoint includes a file named File1.txt.
Your on-premises network contains servers that run Windows Server 2016. The servers are configured as shown in the following table.
az-104-q34.png
You add Share1 as an endpoint for Sync1. One hour later, you add Share2 as an endpoint for Sync1.
Choose all that apply:
---
On the cloud ednpoint, File1.txt is overwritten by File1.txt from Share1 *
On Server1, File1.txt is overwritten by File1.txt from the cloud endpoint
File1.txt from Share1 replicates to Share2 *
---
If you add an Azure file share that has an existing set of files as a cloud endpoint to a sync group, the existing files are merged with any other files that are already on other endpoints in the sync group.
